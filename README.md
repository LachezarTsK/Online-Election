As usual, attached is a file "Default methods and classes given by LeetCode.pdf", which contains classes, methods, etc., around which we must create our solutions, and the names of which cannot be changed. In this problem there is an especially inappropriately named method "int q(int t)", which I would never, ever give such a name.

I point this out, just in case someone looking at my solution fails to notice that this name is given by Leetcode. While the name of the methods given by Leetcode cannot be changed, the names of the parameters can, so in my solution it is "int q(int time)".

If I am to give a name to this method, it would be something of the sort: <br/>"int findTopVotedCandidateAtSelectedTime(int time)"
